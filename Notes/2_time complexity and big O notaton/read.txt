if the time is linearly scaling with the inputs given then the time complexity is 
O(n) -> linear                  // big o of n

if time remain same or constant as we change the input given then the time complexity is
O(1)                            // big o of 1
                or
O(n^0)                            // big o of n raise to power 0
